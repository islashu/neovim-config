Manually configuring the plugins:
 -- These plugins do not have auto installation to attachment procedure,
 -- Installing them in Mason does not auto attach the linter/formatter to the buffer
 -- After installing using Mason, you will have to go into the plugin folder and 
 -- specifically assign the linter/formatter to the filetype, alternatively you can
 -- just use from the preconfig that I already added to multiple different common filetypes
